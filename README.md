# Assignment 7: Web Scraping
For this assignment, I scraped the Wikipedia Web Page for the New York Yankees. Below you will find the CSVs for the headings and the body paragraph text. Additionally, you will find a screenshot of the images folder, where I scraped all the photos included on this Wikipedia page. 

[Code](scrape.py)

[NY Yankees Wiki Headings](yankees_headings.csv)
